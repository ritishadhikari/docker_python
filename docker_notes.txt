1. Docker Compose allows management of Multi Container applications in a coordinated way. Spilt
your work into a number of containers. One for the webserver, one for WSGI application server, one
for a Database engine. It introduces compose files where few simple lines of YAML codes, define such
multi-container applications with necessary runtime environment artifacts.

2. Docker Swarm can allows to define and run applications stack with multiple services, virtual networks,
volumes, configuration files, secrets etc. Each services is made of one or more containers. Swarm can
scale each services independently, adding more replicas or instances of a particular image or decrease it.
Swarm also enables a controlled upgrade of software running in a service. Rolling Upgrades are possible here.
